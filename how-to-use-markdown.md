# How to use MARKDOWN

## Italic

Wrap the word with underscores(\_)

ex. Wrap the word \_ITALIC\_ with underscores.

> Wrap the word _ITALIC_ with underscores.

## Bold

Wrap the word with two asterisks(\*)

ex. Wrap the word \*\*BOLD\*\* with two asterisks.

> Wrap the word **BOLD** with two asterisks.

ex. To make the word \_\*\*italic as well as bold\*\*\_, use both.

> To make the word _**italic as well as bold**_, use both.

## Headers

Start with a hash(\#) to make the line a header

\# for h1, \#\# for h2, ..., \#\#\#\#\#\# for h6.
There is no h7, h8, and so on. Use h1 and h6 sparingly.

ex.  
\# Header 1  
\#\# Header 2  
\#\#\# Header 3  
\#\#\#\# Header 4  
\#\#\#\#\# Header 5  
\#\#\#\#\#\# Header 6  
\#\#\#\#\#\#\# Header 7 doesn't work!

> # Header 1
>
> ## Header 2
>
> ### Header 3
>
> #### Header 4
>
> ##### Header 5
>
> ###### Header 6
>
> ####### Header 7 doesn't work!
